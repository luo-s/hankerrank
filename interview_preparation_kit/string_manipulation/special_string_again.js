/*
A string is said to be a special string if either of two conditions is met:
  1. All of the characters are the same, e.g. aaa.
  2. All characters except the middle one are the same, e.g. aadaa.

A special substring is any substring of a string which meets one of those 
criteria. Given a string, determine how many special substrings can be 
formed from it.
